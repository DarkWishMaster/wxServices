This project is built using wxPython version 3.0, python 2.7. It can be useful to check out some common arising issues in wxpython:
	- database and tables (displaying etc.) using PyGridTableBase
	- wxpython's printer, how to use it to print documents. Here it uses 
	wx.DC to fill the fields in a .png document and then print it.
	- dynamically adding/removing widgets (see order frame, where
	we can add or remove rows)
